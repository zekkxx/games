Constellation Memory!\nThis game is played simply by selecting cards from the 12 that show up in front of you, and not choosing the same card twice! Each time you choose a card, the game will shuffle the cards and reveal a new hand of 12 cards! But don't worry! There will always be at least 1 card that you haven't selected yet in the hand provided to you!\nGive it a shot! Give it a whirl and see if you can beat my own personal high score of 27!`
