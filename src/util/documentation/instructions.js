    constellationMemory: `Welcome to a game of Memory! Constellation Memory! This game is played simply by selecting cards from the 12 that show up in front of you, and not choosing the same card twice! Each time you choose a card, the game will shuffle the cards and reveal a new hand of 12 cards! But don't worry! There will always be at least 1 card that you haven't selected yet in the hand provided to you! Give it a shot! Give it a whirl and see if you can beat my own personal high score of 27!`,
    constellationTrivia: `Welcome to a game of Trivia! Constellation Trivia! This game is played simply by pressing on the button that has the name of the constellation show below! You get 10 seconds per constellation that you'll encounter to answer with the proper name. Fun for star lovers and students alike! Shoot for the stars (or get as close to 100% as you can)!`
